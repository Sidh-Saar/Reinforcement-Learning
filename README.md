# Reinforcement-Learning

In these projects, I used two reinforcement learning algorithms on a dataset with ads and their click rates. This allowed me to determine which ads are the most effective!

An executable .py file can be found for each model, along with a .ipynb file to visualize the model's results on the dataset. Additionally, the dataset is attached.

To speed up model training, Google Colab was used.

These projects were completed through a course on Udemy in July 2023 but were only added to GitHub recently.
